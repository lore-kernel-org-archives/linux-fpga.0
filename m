Hi Alan

Thanks a lot for the feedback. :)

The major concern here is, for virtualization case, after we enable the SRIOV
to create VFs, AFUs(and ports) are turned into VFs from PF. Once AFUs are moved
from PF to VFs, then we should remove all related user interfaces exported by
the afu platform device under PF by unregistering these platform devices from
the system. So in this case the reset controller created by the AFU platform
driver, should be removed when the AFU platform devices are deleted from the
system in this case, but we still have FME and FME bridge present on PF, then
FME bridge can't find the reset controller any longer to do port enable/disable.

Sorry, I found my previous description is not accurate.

VFs could be passed through to a virtual machine, if we let AFU/Port create
reset controller, then the reset controllers are created in the virtual machine.
And FME is always in PF in the host, so FME bridge in host have no access to the
reset controllers in the virtual machine.

Find a reset controller by lookup, if not found, return error code. It seems
not a really hard module dependency between port/afu and FME bridge modules.
But if in FME bridge, it uses functions exposed by port/afu module, that's a
hard dependency. : )

I can try to move related code to afu/port driver instead in the next version
for sure, but I can't create the reset controller per the reason above. Please
let me know if more thoughts on this. : )

I'm not sure if any vendor wants to create a totally different port here, if
yes, then it could have a different feature id in Device Feature Header (DFH).
I think it's possible to use that feature id to decide which driver to load
(or which platform device to create). But vendors don't have to do that, as it
could reuse current port driver and private features added already, or even
add some new vendor specific private feature under the port to save cost.
