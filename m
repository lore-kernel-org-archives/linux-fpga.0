Hi Alan,

Thanks for your review on this patch set.

I only limit this change in DFL framework, because introduce a port ops
here to DFL framework is to resolve the hard dependency between DFL
driver modules (e.g DFL FME and port), this sounds like a DFL specific
thing, and I am not sure if there is some real need or benefit for other
non-DFL module, so i didn't modify the common fpga bridge code.

Hm.. I think we discussed this against v4. It could be a different sub
feature with different id to support different PR hardware.  In that
case, we could still reuse sub feature driver provided by dfl-fme-pr.c
(specify a new id which reuses the same pr_mgmt_ops)

        {
                 .id = FME_FEATURE_ID_PR_MGMT,
                 .ops = &pr_mgmt_ops,
        },

Inside dfl-fme-pr.c, it could parse the different id to create different
platform devices for different FPGA mgrs.

Could we leave this a later change? as i don't have a different hardware
like this at this moment (maybe future) and I don't see current framework
block us on reusing these code.

I fully understand that it's better to make code reusable, this is what
we are trying to do in these patchsets. But it's still not very clear that
who others or which products will use this DFL framework and how, what's
the difficulty they will face and what kind of help or changes we could
provide. so maybe we could defer some work when people really need it, if
there is no hard blocking issue on architecture level.

Looking forward to your feedback. Thanks again for your review. :)
