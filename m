Yes, this is a good discussion, thanks.

Yes, the port reset functions could move into an AFU driver, and then
also the AFU driver could also create a reset controller and register
a lookup [2] for the reset.  That would be just a few lines of code.
The reset controller would control enabling/disabling the port.  The
bridge driver could get the reset controller to use during FPGA
programming.  That is instead of sharing a reset function with the
bridge driver.   It decouples the FPGA bridge driver and simplifies it
to be something that just needs to control a reset instead of needing
to include a specific .h file that makes  a port reset function
available.

Yes, IIUC that may also make it easier as the port/AFU gets added
functionality that is intended to be controlled by the VF anyway
(while the only port-related thing that is needed by the FME is port
enable/disable).

That sounds like an OK type of dependency, i.e. if the modules are not
all loaded, it doesn't work. :-)

The other thing I want to get right now is if there is a different
AFU/port that needs a different driver.  Can the DFL be changed to
specify what AFU/port to load?  I really really want to avoid large
code rewrites in the future that we can anticipate now.  Such as
someone implements their own static image, it has DFL, but the port is
somewhat different.  Instead of seeing features as just something that
gets added, the DFL also specifies what port driver and mgr driver to
load.  The stuff we discussed above is a good step towards that, but
not all of it.
