This doesn't seem like a good way of advertising API availability... Besides
being awkward to query, what happens if a distro kernel has backported some
features but not others that came before?  What does it advertise?

I'd suggest some sort of feature flag mechanism that can be queried via
ioctl (e.g. along the lines of KVM capabilities), if "try the API and fall
back if it fails" is unsatisfactory.

Plus, if it's about new APIs being exposed, this doesn't seem like the right
patch for it to be in...

The driver should refuse to bind to unrecognized revisions, if they're not
expected to be compatible.
