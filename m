Why don't you familiarize yourself with the fpga framework before
commenting on it? ;)

The fpga framework is intended to handle cases where the it is desired
to reprogram the fpga a lot without having to reboot.  It doesn't
sound like that is your use case.

No, and there have been proposals, shot down so far regarding
streaming firmware images a page at a time.
