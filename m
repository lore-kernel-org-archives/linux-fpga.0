Hi Hao,

I've started looking at your v5 here.  It's 5212 lines of code, so
it's not tiny.

I see a lot of renaming from 'fpga' to 'dfl', thanks for doing that.

The main thing that stands out at first look is a new method of
registering port ops.  It would be better if the fpga bridge framework
were expanded or changed somehow to do that.  It's like we have two
bridge frameworks now.

I see that there isn't a way of specifying which FPGA mgr driver to
use, so dfl-fme-mgr.c is tied to dfl-fme-pr.c.  It would be better if
the DFL could specify which fpga manager driver to use.

Maybe I'm repeating myself here, the biggest question I'm asking
myself is: If someone had a different FPGA or a different static
region, how much of this code can be reused?  I would hope that all of
it could except for the fpga manager/bridge drivers.  That was the
intent of the original FPGA framework.  I'll have more time next week
to look in more depth.
