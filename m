Hi Alan,

I unified all the drivers to use dfl-* in the v4 patchset, including fme-mgr.
As I feel it's hard to say which FME functions (sub features, registers) are
vendor specific and which FME functions are not, from the spec, they all belong
to FME, and people can be reused for sure. So I didn't rename it back to Intel
driver in the v4 patchset. :)

Thanks
Hao
