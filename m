Hi Alan

I checked further on this, it seems no good method to avoid feature_dev
specific code (e.g port/fme related code) in DFL framework, as it needs to
manage feature devices for virtualization cases. I tried that, make some
changes that the port reset code could be exported by the port platform
device instead, and fpga-dfl-fme-br.c depends on port platform device to
implement the bridge ops, but 1) it introduced more dependency between
these driver modules which seems not good. (ideally it's better that PR
could be done by FME module itself, no need to have some dependency on
other modules, e.g Port). 2) still have other port code (e.g fpga_port_id
which is useful for port management code in framework) can't be moved to
port platform driver module in the same method. As hardware is designed
this way, even we see separated device features in the DFL, but they have
a lot of dependency internally in different use cases (e.g PR, SRIOV and
etc).
