I was hoping the API mailing list might have an opinion about this,
but I think adding ioctls to the kernel is discouraged.  Could these
be sysfs?

Adding an ioctl that will go away in the future?

I think we are going to have to find a different interface for doing
partial reconfiguration.  There was a recent conversation on the
mailing list regarding adding a header to the raw bitstream and
probably using sysfs to present that to the kernel.  I'm working on
getting an RFC together for that.
