Yes, I will fix this in the next version.

Unfortunately revision 2 is only for integrated FPGA solution, and it doesn't
support any fallback solution (original 32bit data partial reconfiguration is
not supported any more), so driver has to WARN in such path.

Just tried it, my system was down after running above AVX512 with this option.

I agree that it needs to add some check code to make sure it's safe to run
such instructions. I will add some cpu_feature_enabled() check in the next
version.

Thanks a lot for the review and comments.
