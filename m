Hi Alan

No, I don't have any concern on per-region id at all. I will remove this
sysfs interface_id interface from this driver, and another patch to add
a common sysfs interface under the fpga-region. I feel maybe we can use
"compat_id" instead of "id" here to avoid confusion for that sysfs
interface under fpga-region, as we added a region_id to fpga_image_info,
and they have totally different purposes. How do you think?

Thanks
Hao
