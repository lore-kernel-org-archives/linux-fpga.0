I thought earlier you said that 512 bit accesses were required for this
particular integrated-only version of the device, and not just an
optimization?

What's wrong with this?  The driver should never call copy512() if
is_cpu_avx512_enabled() returns 0, and if syzbot can somehow make the driver
do so, then yes we do want a report.
