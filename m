Hi All,

Here is v3 patch-series adding drivers for Intel FPGA devices.

The Intel FPGA driver provides interfaces for userspace applications to
configure, enumerate, open, and access FPGA accelerators on platforms
equipped with Intel(R) PCIe based FPGA solutions and enables system
level management functions such as FPGA partial reconfiguration, power
management and virtualization. It also provides a common framework to
support FPGA devices which implement Device Feature List (DFL) and feature
devices under DFL for better code reuse.

This patch series only adds the basic functions for FPGA accelerators and
partial reconfiguration. Patches for more functions, e.g power management
and virtualization, will be submitted after this series gets reviewed.

Patch 1: add a document for Intel FPGA driver overview, including the HW
architecture, driver organization, device enumeration, virtualization and
opens.

Patch 2: add region_id for fpga_image_info data structure, which allows
driver to pass region id information to fpga-mgr for FPGA reconfiguration
function. (Used by Patch 13)

Patch 3: add a 'status' sysfs interface to fpga-mgr class, it reflects
the status of the fpga-mgr including reconfiguration errors. (Used by
Patch 14)

Patch 4-7: add FPGA device feature list support, it provides common
enumeration interfaces which creates container device (FPGA base region)
and all feature devices by walking through all the 'Device Feature Lists'
provided low level drivers.

Patch 8-9: implement Intel FPGA PCIe device driver. It locates all 'Device
Feature Lists' in PCIe device memory and invokes common interfaces from
above device feature list framework to finish the enumeration.

Patch 10-13: implement FPGA Management Engine (FME) driver. It's a
platform driver matching with the FME platform device created by above
device feature list framework during enumeration. Sysfs and device file
ioctls are exposed as user interfaces to allow partial reconfiguration
to Accelerated Function Units (AFUs) from user space applications.

Patch 14-16: implement FPGA manager/bridge/region platform drivers for
Intel FPGA Management Engine (FME). These platform drivers match with
platform devices created by above FME driver, they use the generic
fpga-mgr/bridge/region class infrastructure to implement FPGA partial
reconfiguration function.

Patch 17-21: implement FPGA Accelerated Function Unit (AFU) driver.
It's a platform driver matching with AFU platform device created by above
device feature list framework during enumeration. It provides user
interfaces to expose the AFU MMIO region, map/unmap dma buffer, and
control the port which AFU connects to.

Changes from v2:
- Split common enumeration code from pcie driver to a separated module
  which for device feature list support.
- Drop fpga-dev class and switch to use fpga base region as container.
- Update the intel-fpga.txt documentation for new driver organization.
- Rename feature device drivers for future code reuse.
- Rebase code due to fpga APIs changes
- replace bitfields with marco and shift.
- fix typos, checkpatch issue and other comments.

Changes from v1:

- Use GPLv2 license instead of Dual BSD/GPL.
- Move the code to drivers/fpga folder.
- Update the intel-fpga.txt documentation for new driver organization.
- Add documentation for new sysfs interfaces.
- Switch to use common fpga-region interface for partial reconfiguration
  (PR) function in FME. It creates fpga-region/fpga-mgr/fpga-bridge
  platform devices and leave the implementation to their platform drivers.
- Add platform drivers for FME fpga-mgr/bridge/region platform devices.
- Fix kbuild warnings, typos and other comments.

This patch series depends on the below patchset from Alan Tull.
