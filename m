Sorry, I missed the comment about revision 2 only being on integrated
devices -- but will that always be the case?  Seems worthwhile to check for
AVX512 support anyway.  And there's still the possibility of being built
with an old binutils such that CONFIG_AS_AVX512 is not set, or running on a
kernel where avx512 was disabled via a boot option.

What about future revisions >= 2?  Currently the driver will treat them as
if they were revision < 2.  Is that intended?
