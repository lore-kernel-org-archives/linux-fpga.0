device.h [1] says it better than me:

 * A bus is a channel between the processor and one or more devices.
For the
 * purposes of the device model, all devices are connected via a bus,
even if
 * it is an internal, virtual, "platform" bus. Buses can plug into
each other.
 * A USB controller is usually a PCI device, for example. The device
model
 * represents the actual connections between buses and the devices
they control.

A fpga-bridge could be the bus even if the FPGA is on PCIe.  The
advantage of doing it that way is that this bus will be usable for
both embedded and PCIe FPGAs.
