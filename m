Hi Alan

Does 'base bridge' mentioned above mean a hardware bridge just like
PCIe or USB?

I tried to use fpga bus type device instead of fpga-dev class today,
it works for me, e.g Intel FPGA device PCIe driver could create a
fpga bus type dev as a child of PCIe device and its sysfs path will be
changed to /sys/bus/fpga/devices/fpga.x/ from /sys/class/fpga/fpga.x/.
For now, this fpga bus type device is only used as container device,
so no driver needed for it.

Do you have any concern on this? I see fpga bus type works fine, but
I didn't see other advantages for this case, as we only use it as a
container device to represent a FPGA device in sysfs hierarchy. :)
