Hi Alan

Actually I think we can't move all the bridge code to fpga-dfl-fme-br.c as
this bridge (and region) is created by FME PR sub feature code, mainly for
PR function. But user may need the reset function when run some workload
on target Port/AFU, if consider virtualization case (SRIOV), there is only
Port/AFU in each VF, and no FME in VF (that means nobody creates the fpga
region/bridge/region). So it's need from port platform driver side as well.

The orignal idea that creates fpga-mgr/bridges/regions under FME, is that
even we turned all Ports/AFUs into VFs (user can not see port platform
device and the user interfaces exposed by port driver on PF), but user
still can use FME to do PR to those Ports/AFUs in turned into VFs (assigned
in different virtual machines).

I fully agree with you, that we should avoid feature specific code in the
common enumeration code and feature device framework if possible. I guess
I need some time to check and see if any other solutions (e.g export those
functions from port driver not DFL framework). Will back here once I have
some clear idea.:)

Thanks
Hao
